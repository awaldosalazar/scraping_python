# Scraping with Python

## Prerequisites

**Installing Python**

Make sure that you have [Python3 installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine.

You might want to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) standard Python library
to create virtual environments and have Python, pip and all dependent packages to be installed and 
served from the local project directory to avoid messing with system wide packages and their 
versions.

Depending on your installation you might have access to Python3 interpreter either by
running `python` or `python3`. The same goes for pip package manager - it may be accessible either
by running `pip` or `pip3`.

You may check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

Note that in this repository whenever you see `python` it will be assumed that it is Python **3**.

**Installing dependencies**

Install all dependencies that are required for the project by running:
